Login branch, known issues:
- do not add "local.properties" to git; everyone has their own as it is dependent on your file path
- make sure to configure a google console project with this project's SHA-1, otherwise google sign in will not work
- if google sign in doesnt work, the app crashes when entering the profile fragment
